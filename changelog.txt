- Boot time to apply tweak 60s -> 30s
- Increased vfs_cache_pressure to 40 (This to avoid out-of-memory conditions)

- Disabled swap readahead completely
- Increased kernel.perf_cpu_time_max_percent to 40 (This might increase performance)
- Low latency for busy_poll & busy_read (This might incease power usage)
